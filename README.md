# BackUpTmp
Repo to hold shell script that backs up my local repos

I added a while loop that reads user input, specifically a [Y/N], and promts the user to create a new temp. copy of the local repos folder. My usual folder, but code can be easily editted for anothers use. I added it to my bash.bashrc file.
